# Frontend Architecture

How the UI is built and how it behaves.

**Scope.** Visual craft — palette, type, layout, motion, copy voice — is `frontend-design`. Measuring
what it costs is `{{skill:performance-analysis}}`. Mobile-first and the size of a loading state are already rules
in the global contract. Framework, router, and data library are the repository's decisions and live in
its own `AGENTS.md`; nothing here names one.

Written for browser UI: the URL section and bundle cost assume the web. Everything else — state
ownership, data entry, forms, async surfaces, contract types, accessibility — holds on native too.

## Component boundaries
- **Small, single-purpose, composable.** One component does one thing.
- **Separate what renders from what decides.** Presentational components take props and return UI;
  logic and data live above them, in a composable unit — never in a base class, never in a deep leaf.
- **Props are a contract** — typed, minimal, no boolean-flag soup. Prefer composition (slots, children)
  over configuration: a component that grew five booleans wanted to be three components.
- **A component that fetches, decides, and renders is three responsibilities** wearing one name. Split
  it the moment the second one needs a test.

## State — five owners, pick the narrowest
Every piece of state has exactly one owner. Naming it is most of the architecture.

| Owner | What belongs to it |
|---|---|
| **Server cache** | Remote data. Fetched, cached, invalidated — never copied into anything else. |
| **URL** | Anything that must survive a reload or be shareable: filters, tab, page, selection, sort. |
| **Form** | In-flight edits, until submit resolves. |
| **Component-local** | State nothing outside this component reads. |
| **Global client** | Only the genuinely cross-cutting: session, theme, notifications. |

- **Derive, don't duplicate.** Compute from the source instead of syncing a copy; two copies of one
  truth drift, and the bug appears in whichever one you weren't looking at.
- **The most common damage is remote data copied into global state** — now the cache and the copy
  disagree, and invalidation fixes only one of them.
- **The second most common is view state trapped in a component** when it belonged in the URL. That
  single mistake breaks the back button, reload, and sharing at once.

## The URL is part of the architecture
- **The reload test:** refresh the page — does the user land where they were? **The link test:** send
  the URL to someone else — do they see the same view?
- Filters, pagination, sort, active tab, selected record, and open detail panel all pass or fail those
  two tests. If they fail, that state is in the wrong place.
- **What never goes in the URL:** secrets, tokens, personal data, and genuinely ephemeral UI state
  (hover, a transient toast). URLs are logged, shared, and kept in history.
- **Back and forward are a contract with the user**, not an implementation detail of the router.

## Where data enters
- **Fetch at the route level by default.** A component that fetches its own data chains a round trip
  behind whatever rendered it — many small independent fetches become a serial waterfall, and the page
  is as slow as the deepest chain.
- **The cache key is the identity of the request.** Every parameter that changes the response belongs
  in it, or two different requests share one entry.
- **A mutation invalidates what it affects, explicitly.** "It'll refetch eventually" is a stale screen
  the user is about to act on.
- **An optimistic update needs its rollback written in the same change.** Without it you have a bug
  that looks like speed — the screen says it worked and the server disagreed.
- **Handle the request states where the data enters**, not in every consumer downstream.

## Server and client
- **The axis is what renders where, and why.** Whatever the framework calls it, the decision is the
  same: server-rendered by default, client interactivity added deliberately where it's needed.
- **Push the boundary as low and as late as possible.** An interactive leaf should not force its whole
  ancestry to become client code.
- **Secrets and heavy work stay on the server side of the boundary** — anything past it is public.
- **Hydration is a cost, not a free upgrade.** Every interactive island ships code and re-executes work
  the server already did; measuring that cost is `{{skill:performance-analysis}}`.

## The trust boundary
- **Client validation is UX; the server is enforcement.** Every rule that exists only in the interface
  does not exist. Duplicating a rule on both sides is fine and expected — treating the client copy as
  the guarantee is not.
- **Permission-driven rendering is convenience, not authorization.** Hiding a button hides nothing:
  the endpoint behind it is what must refuse.
- **No secret reaches client code**, including config variables that get inlined into the bundle. What
  ships to the browser is public by definition — the contract's env rules apply here without exception.
- **Data from elsewhere is input, including your own backend's.** Anything that becomes markup, a URL,
  or a redirect target is untrusted until it is treated as such.

## Forms
Where most real UI bugs live, and the cheapest ones to prevent.

- **One source of truth per field.** A controlled value plus a separate copy is a race with the user.
- **Validate on blur and on submit, not on every keystroke.** Errors that appear while someone is still
  typing their email teach them to ignore errors.
- **Guard the double submit at the handler**, not only by disabling the button — the second submit
  arrives from the keyboard, the slow network, or the impatient double-click regardless.
- **Errors go next to the field they belong to**, plus a summary when the form is long enough to scroll
  the first error off screen. Move focus to the first error.
- **A failed submit preserves everything the user typed.** Losing a filled form to a server error is
  the worst cheap bug there is.

## Async surfaces
- **Four states, always: loading, empty, error, and partial.** Empty is not loading — "no results for
  this filter" and "still fetching" look identical to the user unless you make them different.
- **An error state carries a way out** — retry, go back, or contact — never a bare message.
- **Failure is isolated.** One widget that fails to load must not blank the page around it; the rest of
  the screen stays usable.
- **The loading state's size is a rule of the global contract** (a skeleton changes appearance, never
  size) — follow it there, it is not restated here.

## Contract types
The types describing the backend's responses are either **generated from the backend's own schema** or
**hand-written and therefore a drift source**. There is no honest third option. Pick one deliberately
and record it — a hand-copied type that silently stopped matching is a runtime error wearing a
compile-time disguise.

## Accessibility (non-negotiable)
- **Semantic elements first; ARIA only to fill a real gap.** A native control brings keyboard, focus,
  and announcement for free — a rebuilt one owes all three.
- **Keyboard-navigable with visible focus**, and no focus trap that a keyboard cannot leave.
- **Manage focus on route change and on open/close** of any overlay. Focus left behind on a removed
  element strands a keyboard user with no position.
- **Every interactive element labeled; images have alt; color is never the only signal; contrast meets
  WCAG AA.**
- **Announce async results.** A screen that updated silently did not update for everyone.

## Validation checklist
- [ ] Every piece of state has exactly one named owner among the five.
- [ ] Remote data lives in the server cache and is not copied elsewhere.
- [ ] The reload test and the link test pass for filters, tabs, pagination, and selection.
- [ ] Data enters at the route level; no accidental fetch waterfall; mutations invalidate explicitly.
- [ ] No rule enforced only on the client; no secret past the server/client boundary.
- [ ] Forms: one source per field, double-submit guarded, input preserved on failure.
- [ ] Every async surface has loading, empty, error, and partial — and failure is isolated.
- [ ] Keyboard, focus management, labels, and contrast covered.
- [ ] Contract types generated, or hand-written with the drift risk explicitly accepted.

## Never do
- Put data-fetching or business rules in a deep presentational component.
- Copy remote data into global client state, or keep two copies of one truth.
- Leave shareable view state out of the URL, or put a secret into it.
- Treat client-side validation, or a hidden control, as enforcement.
- Ship a secret, key, or token in anything the browser downloads.
- Ship an async surface missing empty or error, or an interactive UI that a keyboard can't use.
- Lose the user's input to a failed submit.
