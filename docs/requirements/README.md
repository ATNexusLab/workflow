# Workflow — Software Requirements Specification

**Version:** 1.0.0 · **Date:** 2026-10-02 · [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

## Purpose

The workflow is a way of working with coding agents: an always-on working contract, on-demand skills,
commands for each step of the development loop, a read-only verifier subagent, a curated memory layer,
and a status line.

Today it exists as one person's private configuration of a single harness, installed by a guided script
that merges files into the harness's user directory. That form reaches one harness, cannot be installed
piece by piece, and is edited in a place nobody else can install from.

This product packages the workflow as an installable plugin for four agent harnesses, built from one
canonical source, so that anyone can install it with the harness's own plugin mechanism and choose which
optional parts to turn on.

## Scope

In scope:

- The canonical source of every workflow piece.
- One plugin per harness — Claude Code, Cursor, Antigravity CLI, Codex — released in that order
  ([BR-01](business-rules.md#br-01)).
- Delivery of the contract, the skills, the commands, and the verifier.
- The memory layer: its automatic functions, its note functions, and the vault template.
- The status line, as an opt-in.
- Installation, the choice of optional components, update, uninstall, and migration from the pre-plugin
  install.

Out of scope:

| Item | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Listing in a harness vendor's official or curated marketplace | It depends on each vendor's review. The plugin installs from this repository's own catalog without it. |
| Personal harness settings: theme, effort, notifications, enabled plugins, permissions | They are one machine's preferences, not workflow, and a plugin cannot carry them. |
| The hook that names a harness's per-project memory folder after the project | It is per-machine wiring of one harness and stays in the maintainer's private configuration. |
| Editing the contract through the plugin, or layering rules over it | The contract is the maintainer's; an adopter turns it on or off ([BR-04](business-rules.md#br-04)). |
| Any rule or function a companion plugin already provides | The companion owns it ([BR-05](business-rules.md#br-05)). |
| MCP servers | The workflow provisions none by design. |
| The pre-plugin distribution: setup scripts, the guided install document, the archive export, the settings generator | Plugin installation replaces them. |
| The content of any person's vault | It is private data and never ships ([NFR-SEC-02](non-functional/security.md#nfr-sec-02)). |
| Harnesses other than the four named | None was requested. |
